.SH NAME
lmeter \- 
.BR lmeter (1) 
configuration file format and configuration parameters
.SH SYNOPSIS
see 
.BR lmeter (1)
.SH DESCRIPTION
All 
.BR lmeter (1) 
configuration parameters are supplied either in a command line or from
a file in the
.BR lmeter (5) 
format (preferred). This document describes this format and all valid
configuration options (useful for command line usage too).
.SH FILE FORMAT
File is considered to be a sequence of 
.IR lines . 
Each line is either a comment line (if it starts from the
number sign '#' as the first character in the line) or a command line.
Command line consists of a parameter name (the first 
word separated by a sequence of blanks or tab characters),
and the parameter value (the rest of the line). 
.LP
While each parameter can occur several times in a set of
configuration files that 
.BR lmeter (1) 
reads, only the 
.I first 
encountered definition is used. This provides the
opportunity to tune some parameters for a particular run by supplying
them in a file that 
.BR lmeter (1) 
reads 
.I before 
the standard configuration files with technology description.
.LP
While the parameter names are case-insensitive, it is strongly
encouraged to be consistent in uppercase usage.
.SH INDIVIDUAL PARAMETERS DESCRIPTION
What follows is the individual parameter description. Please see the
supplied sample configuration files for usage examples.
.LP 
.BF Note:
The following convention was assumed: when we speak about
.IR layers , 
we refer to a CAD system layers, to which geometrical
objects in layout design tool are assigned; while the term
.I film 
is reserved to refer to the films of either superconductor or
insulator that are deposited (and etched) on a chip and have a
particular thicknesses and a particular order. There is usually no
one-to-one correspondence between layers and films.
.SH INPUT FILE. UNITS AND SCALING
.TP
.\" dxcname
\fB dxcname
- input DXC (see 
.BR dxc (5))
file name. If this parameter is specified, input geometry is
supplied in this file, otherwise the standard input is used.
.TP
.\" gridsize	50
\fB gridsize \fI float
- the smallest finite element size, in CAD units (units that are used
in 
.BR dxc (5)
file). \fI E.g., \fR if design is supplied with 1 CAD unit equal to
0.01 um (as in CIF) and user wants the smallest finite element to have
0.5 um size, then gridsize is equal to 0.5/0.01=50 CAD units.
.TP
.\" unitsize	0.01
\fB unitsize \fI float
- one CAD unit in microns. For our example it would be equal to
0.01.
.TP
.\" currunit	0.125
\fB currunit \fI float 
- current unit in mA. The calculated terminal
currents for unit phase drop will be expressed in these usits and the
corresponding net inductances \fI in PSCAn units \fR will be equal to
one over these currents. If you want to get inductances in pH you
should make this current unit equal to 0.329 mA (this value gives
PSCAn unit of inductance Le=F0/(2*Pi*Ie) equal to 1 pH) As a special
case this current unit may be set to 0 to calculate
.I resistance
of a complex configuration in resistive layer. Additional information
is available upon request.
.TP
.\" kmax		4
\fB kmax \fI int 
- maximal order of grid decimation. The
.I largest 
finite element may have size equal to 
.I 2^kmax * gridsize \fR .
.TP
.\" kmin		1
\fB kmax \fI int 
- really not used now (but you'd better specify it to be equal to 1, 
please).
.TP
.\" exist45
\fB exist45 
- if this parameter is specified, \fI gridsize \fR is
additionaly divided by 2. It is necessary in that (rare) case when
gridsize is equal to one CAD snap unit and design contains 45 degree
lines. Then their intersection points may fall on the two times
smaller snap and \fI gridsize \fR should be decreased. Usually it is
not necessary.
.SH TECHNOLOGY DESCRIPTION. LAYERS AND FILMS 
.TP
\fB nlayers \fI int
- the total number of layers including the \fI TERM \fR layer.
.\" nlayers		11
.TP 
\fB laynames \fI name,...
- all layer names that appear on the layout.
.\" laynames	TERM M0  I0  M1  I1A  R2  I1B  M2  I2  M3  R3
.TP 
.\" laycolors	15   6   7   1   4    2   16   3   5   8   16   
\fB laycolors \fI int,...
- if 
.BR lmeter (1)
is compiled with debugging PostScript printout support this parameter
specifies the colors in which different layers are drawn. See
.I show_ps.c 
for a number-to-color correspondence. 
.TP
.\" psprint
\fB psprint
- if 
.BR lmeter (1)
is compiled with debugging PostScript printout support and this
parameter is specified, that printout is really produced.
.TP
.\" nfilms		12
\fB nfilms \fI int 
- number of physical films. The following
parameters have \fI nfilms+1 \fR items after the keyword. These
correspond to all films (from bottom to top) plus one additional dummy
film in the leftmost (zero) position (do not ask me why did I need it,
but think a bit about C vs. Fortran numbering scheme and recall that
the first version of this progream was written in Fortran ;-) ).
.TP
.\" filmtype        N   S    I    S    I   I    I   I    I   S    I   S    I
\fB filmtype \fI (N|I|S),...
- film type, either None (used for dummy films, notably the first
one), Insulator or Superconductor.
.TP 
.\" filmpar	 	0 .100 .15 .086 .003 .05   .1   .12 .1  .085 .5  .085 1.27
\fB filmtype \fI float,...
- one parameter per film, either thickness for insulator films or
London penetration depth (actually multiplied by these 
.IR cth s)
for superconductors.
.TP
.\" filmshift       0  0.25  0   0.0   0   0    0    0   0  0.25 0  0.375 0
\fB filmshift \fI float,...
- shift (in um) of superconductor film boundaries due to
overetching. Each boundary is shifted towards center by this value, 
.IR e.g. , 
shift 0.25 um means that a microstrip line on chip is 
0.5 um narrower than designed. It is impossible (due to arising
numerical instabilities) to specify 
.I filmshift
larger then half the 
.I gridsize * unitsize
value. Larger shifts may be taken into account by preprocessing with
some mask manipulation program.
.TP
.\" layconf[TERM]	1   1    1    0    0   0    0    0   1   0    1   0    0
\fB layconf[\fIlayername\fB] \fI (1|0)|(+|-),...  
- several lines of this form provide information about layer to film
correspondence. For each layer 
.I one 
(or 
.I plus 
) in some
position means this layer has the corresponding bit set in its 
.I configuration vector \fR.
This configuration vector is used in the following procedure:
first, a vector of existing films is initialised by the configuration
vector of the 
.I TERM
layer, then the whole geometry is sweeped
from left to right and when during this sweep a line in some layer is
encountered the vector of existing films is 
.IR xor 'ed
with the configuration vector of this layer. Consequently, 
.I one 
in the configuration vector for the 
.I TERM 
layer marks a 
.I negative 
film (
.I i.e., 
film for which user draw 
.I holes
) and it should have 
.I one 
in its leftmost position). This
also means that two overlapping geometries in the same layer will
produce a 
.I hole 
in the corresponding film where they are
overlapping. Usually it is not a desired effect, and such geometries
should be eliminated during preprocessing.
.TP
.\" filmmask	0   0    0    0    3   3   -8    0   0   0    0   0
\fB filmmask \fI int,...
- this parameter is used to erase or add films at some point if some
other film exists (or not exists) at this point. If some film has a
positive number N in the corresponding position, then this film is 
deleted from everywhere where film number N does not exist, and if
this number is negative, then this film is created in the places where
film number N exists. Dummy first film has number 0 and it is assumed
to exist everywhere.
.SH TERMINALS
Terminals are the geometrical objects (drawn in the 
.I TERM 
layer) that are connected to a pair of films between which phase
drops may be specified and currents through terminals are calculated by
.BR lmeter (1).
Each 
.I I-source 
terminal is assigned a unit phase drop (between
its upper and lover films) in turn and currents through all other
.I active 
terminals (both sources and shorts) are calculated.
.TP
.\" termtype
\fB termtype \fI (N|I|S),...
- terminal type, either Null, I-source or Short. Null
terminals are considered inactive in the current run.   
.TP
.\" termup
\fB termup \fI (layername|*),...
.TP
\fB termdown \fI (layername|*),...  - these parameters specify upper
and lower films that are connected by each terminal. For convenience a
layer names are used instead of film numbers, but these layers should
have one and only one film in their config vectors (and it should be
superconductive). Star is substituted by the
.I default 
layer name. 
.\" deftermup	M2
.\" deftermdown	M1
.TP
\fB deftermup \fI layername
.TP
\fB deftermdown \fI layername
- the majority of terminals in real circuits connect upper and lower
films of Josephson trilayer, and the layer names that correspond to
these films may be specified as \fI defaults. \fR
.SH BOUNDARY INDUCTANCES
.BR lmeter (1) 
takes into account 3D effects in magnetic field distribution using the
notation of a 
.I boundary inductances
-- the imaginary inductances connected in parallel with a
microstrip line do describe inductance decrease due to 3D
effects. They may be viewed as a set of adjustment coefficients that
allows one to fit
.BR lmeter (1)'s
results for long microstrip lines to the results given by other
programs (
.IR e.g. , 
Chang's program). 
.\" bulklambda	0.085
.TP
\fB bulklambda \fI float
- we have found that the best results in this approximation may be
achieved if the microstrip line width is decreased by the value of
London's penetration depth from both sides. This is the value to use
as the penetration depth.  
.TP
\fB Coeff3D0 \fI float
.TP
\fB Coeff3D1 \fI float
.TP
\fB Coeff3D2 \fI float
- values of the boundary 
.I admittances 
for a microstrip line segment with no ``groundplane'' at all, with one
``groundplane'' (open upper or lower semispace) or two
``groundplanes'' (both under and over the microstip line). The role of
``groundplane'' is played by any superconductive layer other than the
one of the microstrip line. These admittances are calculated in the
following way:
.br
.in +0.5i
.I Y=1/2*(mu0/L3D - mu0/L2D)
.br
.in -0.5i
where L3D is an inductance of a microstrip line per micron calculated
by the other program, and L2D is a usual 2D value: 
.br
.in +0.5i
.I L2D=mu0*dmag/(w-2*bulklambda)
.br
.in -0.5i
Width (and layer) for microstrip line are choosed to be the most
common used in the particular technology, or, preferably, several
configurations may be considered and the coefficient values are
choosen to minimize the relative error in
.BR lmeter (1) 
calculation in comparison with the other program.
