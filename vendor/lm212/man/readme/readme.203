
        L-Meter 2.03

	This is preliminary (alfa) version. 

     	NEW FEATURES:

        Built-in solver included ! When compiled __without__ OLDLM3
defined, the result of LM's work is not huge data files for LM3 solver,
but the current matrix itself. You can use it as input to LM2CIR program
(by S.Polonsky) to extract an equivalent circuit.

        The current matrix is returned to stdout (while all the mess to
stderr) as number of triplets: <IOUT ITEA CURRENT> where IOUT - No. of 
terminal-source, ITEA - No. of active (not dummy) terminal, CURRENT -
current through the terminal ITEA when phi across IOUT is equal to 1.

        Those IOUT & ITEA are equal to terminal's ELEV values in ACAD.
Please note that this is NOT equivalent to the old CURS.TXT file format -
they are equivalent only if all terminals are defined as current sources.

        Probably you'll want to customise some parameters of the solver.
All solver's stuff (including header with the parameters) is stored at
SRC/CSSPDMS subdirectory (for C Sparse Simmetric Positive-Definite Matrix
Solver). 

        Surely, with OLDLM3 defined you'll get the same LMeter as before
(with some bugs fixed).

        KNOWN BUGS:

        Version of NDP C compiler I have doesn't support compilation of
dir/file.c, I used dir\file.c instead, but this interfered with '\' escape
sequences in __FILE__ macro.

        With NDP C I failed to separate stdout & stderr (probably, the 
problem is with my NDP C installation).

        Subdirectory support in .MAK files is too rude. If somebody knows how 
to do it better - please let me know.

        COMING SOON:

        Built-in fringing - factors.

        New outlm.lsp to support blocks, "wide" objects, etc.
