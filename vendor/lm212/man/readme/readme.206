L-Meter 2.06

NEW FEATURES

        Boundary inductances (and technology cut-off) are
added: now you can specify the three values of reciprocal
boundary inductances for microstrip line over the hole in
the groundplane, over the groundplane and between two
groundplanes. Note, that there is no correction for MSL's
inductance __under__ the groundplane. You also can specify
the changes in geometry sizes while fabrication (less then
half of grid size, otherwise you'll get warning and those
shifts would be truncated). See 'hypres.dfl' and 'CSE.dfl'
for comments and suggested values of those coeffitients,
but you should make your own set of tests to get those
values. In 'hypres.dfl' those values were calculated using
simple estimations, and in 'CSE.dfl' they were calculated
using Chang's program for several particular geometries in
this technology. The same work for Hypres technology must
be done later.

        The directory structure is changed. Sources of some
utilities are added to the src directory, including
'dxcview' - simple BGI utility to view DXC files, 'cif2dxc'
- a CIF to DXC converter and S. Polonsky's 'lm2cir'.

        The NDP compiler is supported (again!), makefile
for UNIX with GCC is also included. To build LMeter itself,
enter src/lmeter and run "make -f makefile.ndp". See
makefiles for additional targets. Please note, that (since
NDP compiler doesn't support -M option to build the
dependencies) when changing one of headers you have to
erase .obj files manually to rebuild them - sorry for
unconvenience. Sure, UNIX makefile works well. Utilities
are built separately.

        OUTLM program now supports block structure and wide
plines in ACAD designs, you can also specify (in
_skip_.lsp) the list of block names to exclude from
extraction (JJs & non-inductive M0 holes).  Lisp files are
stored in src/outlm, you have to put them in ACAD directory
and (load "outlm").

        You can specify the name of LM defaults file
(lm.dfl in previous versions) in environment variable
LM_DEFAULTS, for example: 
	set LM_DEFAULTS=/usr/lmeter/tech/CSE.dfl 
to work with the technology described in this file. If this
variable is not assigned, LMeter reads './lm.dfl'.

KNOWN BUGS:

        Don't try to specify the terminals that cross metal
layers - sometimes it works, but in general case it
doesn't.
