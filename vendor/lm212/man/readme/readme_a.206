NEW FEATURES

	Boundary inductances and technology cut-offs are added not only to
the MSL boundary over the groundplane, but also to the groundplane over the 
MSL. 

	See 'test/upgnd' for an example. Currents in two MSL would be the
same, if M1 and M2 have the same cut-off (it is necessary to modify
'hypres.dfl' to test this case).

TO BE DONE:

	Boundary coefficients have to be recalculated using Chang's
program.

	This feature was not tested with more complex examples.
