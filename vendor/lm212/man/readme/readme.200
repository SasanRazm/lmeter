
        Here is the LM 2.00 program with the same functions as the previous
NewLM, but with better directory structure and make files. 

        GCC support included!

        You can test the program using two examples in TEST directory,
examples of *.DFL files for HYPRES technology are there also. 

        Please, wait for the next versions.
