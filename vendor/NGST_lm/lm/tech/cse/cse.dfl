rem     One minor (I hope) bug exists in this table - absence
rem     of the isolator layer that fills holes in M2 (harmless,
rem     since there is no metal layer under M2.
rem	Layer sequence is inverse - I hope, no difference, but
rem	boundary effects are handled better.

rem	Shift is the difference (in um) between the layout size
rem	of the metal electrodes and the real size. Shift is positive 
rem	if the real size is smaller than the layout one. This shift
rem	is subtracted from the both sides. In other words, metal 
rem	object on chip is 2*shift um narrower.
rem	Note, that LMeter can't handle shifts larger then 
rem	'unitsize'*'gridsize'/2 (using of 'octmm' is recommended to 
rem	shrink the geometry).

rem	They (multiplied by the grid size) are added to the conductivity 
rem	of the metal sector, if this sector contains a metal boundary. The number
rem 	of 'grounds' over and under the sector determine which coeffitient 
rem	is actually used.
