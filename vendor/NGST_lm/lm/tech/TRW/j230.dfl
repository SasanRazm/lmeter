# N.B. Insulator films are "overetched" when covering metal is etched, thus they are split into two films each, 
# e.g., SIOG0 and SIOG1. Sum of their thicknesses is TDR value of SIOG thickness, SIOG1 is the overetching amount 
# and it exists only if covered by TRIW (as specified in filmmask). Same with other insulator layers.
#
# SIOA mask etches both SIOA and SIOR films. The way it is implemented here assumes that SIOA and SIOR vias can not
# overlap. This can be fixed, but it looks like this configuration is forbidden by TDR.  

# Quentin's fit of inductance teble as of Sep. 2002: 
# all lambdas are 0.35 um; each metal layer has 0.1 um "dead layer" at the bottom.
# Implemented by adding 0.1 um of insulator to "overetch" layers

# GNDC name was re-used to introduce extra insulator film TRIWI on TRIW place where TRIW was removed. 
# Since SIOG1 is masked out in these places, TRIWI thickness is: SIOG overetch + 0.2 um of (removed) TRIW
