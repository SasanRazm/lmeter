.SH NAME
lmeter \- program for superconductive inductances calculation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lmeter -s
.I var=name
.I file ... 
.br		
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IR lmeter (1) 
computes a current flowing through 
.I terminals
of a multilayer superconductive integrated circuit in several
"experiments" when unit 
Josephson phase difference across one of the terminals \- 
.I current sources
and zero phase differencies across other terminals are
applied. 
.PP
Used approach is based on the solution of 2D laplace equation on Josephson
phase differencies between superconductive layers with coefficients
adjusted to take into account 3D effects and changes in feature sizes 
during fabrication.
.PP
Input is a layout description in our special 
.IR dxc (5)
format (converter from 
.I CIF
and exporters from 
.I AutoCAD
and
.I Design Framework II
are available) together with the problem and technology description files (
.IR lmeter (5)),
output is a matrix of 
.I admittances 
between terminals. This matrix is written to the standard output stream as
a set of lines in the form:
.TP
.I <first terminal> <second terminal> <current>
.TP
where
.I current
is the current flowing through the second terminal when the unit phase drop
on the first one and zero on others are applied
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.B \-s 
.I <name> = <value>
allows user to specify a value of LMeter's internal variable
via the command line.
.PP
Files specified in the command line are readed one by one to assign
values to LMeter's internal variables. See 
.IR lmeter (5)
for a description of this format and all variables.
Only the 
.I first 
encountered assingment to any variable is taken into account.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
.I ./lm.dfl
(if exists) is processed after all files in the command line.
.PP
.I $LM_DEFAULTS
is a shell variable to specify a filename to read after 
.I ./lm.dfl.
Usually the technology description is given in this file.   
.SH BUGS
.PP
Overlapping geometries in the same layer are XOR'ed, not OR'ed. Use
some prepocessing program like 
.I octmm
to get rid of those.
.PP
Only manhattan geometries (and
.I probably
geometries with 45 degree elements) may be processed.
.PP
Terminal can not pass through a superconductive layer.
