
        L-Meter 2.02

     	NEW FEATURES:

	You can use negative coordinates in your layout !!!

        BUGS FIXED:

        LM doesn't apply now strupr() to filenames and dirnames (like test.dxc 
in "DXCNAME = test.dxc"), but it still applies it to left-hand side of those 
assignments (for example to "DXCNAME" ) and to right-hand side of the 
assignments with non-filename values (for example, "TDOWN = grd GRD"). 
In other words, you can use both cases in LM's input exept when specifying 
filename or dirname in case-sensitive system like UNIX.
