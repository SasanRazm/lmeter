
        L-Meter 2.04

     	NEW FEATURES:

        New OUTLM with support of INSERT, MINSERT, PLINE (with & w/out
width). 

        In 'lm.dfl' the real parameter of SC layer is modified: instead of
(d+lambda1+lambda2) (d+lambda1*Coth[b1/lambda1]+lambda2*Coth[b2/lambda2])
is used.

	The resulting current matrix is saved in 'curs.txt' file.

	Variable initial Threshold.

	Iterative solver guarantees 4 significant digits of the final 
result (i.e. current matrix) after decimal point.
 
	Some bugs were fixed (special thanks to P.Shevchenko).

        COMING SOON:

        Built-in fringing - factors are still waiting ...
