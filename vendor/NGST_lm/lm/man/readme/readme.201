
        L-Meter 2.01 

        NEW FEATURES:

        Subboundary points are decimated now. (Run BC's graphical version to
watch the new grids!).

        User MUST NOT draw TERM 0 line now, but the variable LINECNF[TERM] (in
file LM.DFL) must be defined with 1s in the positions of "negative" layers as
before. 

	Better MAKE files.

        RESTRICTIONS:

        Negative coordinates are not supported yet (will be fixed soon).
