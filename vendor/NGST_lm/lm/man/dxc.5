.SH SYNOPSIS
see 
.BR lmeter (1)
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a simple flat geometry description format to specify a set 
of lines and polylines attached to different layers.

.SH NOTES
\(bu
As many spaces/tabs/newlines may be used as necessary.
.LP
\(bu
Layer names should be declared in technology description file (see 
.BR lmeter (5)). 
They may not start from the dollar sign (it marks
keywords).
.LP
\(bu
While each polyline is assigned an integer number, this number has
meaning only for terminals (that are drawn using layer
.IR TERM ).
If several polylines in layer 
.I TERM
share the same number they are considered to be different parts of one
terminal. 
.LP
\(bu
The majority of polylines in designs are 
.I closed
and they should have the last point
.I xn yx 
the same as the first one. Terminals are built from open polylines
sometimes (usually when a terminal is just a straight line on the end
of a microstrip line), in this case they should not have the first
point repeated at the end.
.LP
\(bu
While coordinates may be floating point numbers, they should be
integer multiples of the declared 
.I gridsize
(see
.BR lmeter (5)).
.LP
.SH BUGS
This format looks ugly in general... ;-)
