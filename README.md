LMeter
======



lmeter computes a current flowing through terminals of a multilayer superconductive integrated 
circuit in several experiments when unit Josephson phase difference across one of the terminals - 
current sources and zero phase differencies  across  other  terminals  are applied.  Used  
approach is based on the solution of 2D laplace equation on Josephson phase differencies 
between superconductive layers with coefficients adjusted to take into account 3D effects 
and changes in feature sizes during fabrication.
